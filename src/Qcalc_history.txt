Qcalc version history

* Release 5.01
        - Added feature to calculate solute entropies using Schlitter's formula
          and quasiharmonic analysis.
          
        - Added feature to calculate nonboded interactions between defined atoms
          from a dcd or restart file.
          
        - Added feature to calculate nonbonded interactions between a set of 
          residues, the protein, and atoms in a second set, e.g. q-atoms,
          from a dcd or restart file. Nonbonded interactions are calculated
          and averaged for one residue at the time to all q-atoms. 

* Release 4.25, 00-11-25
	Fixed problem with setting reference coordinates from a restart file.

* Release 4.21, 00-08-25
	Changed call to sign function to compile on SGI.

* Beta version 4.18, 00-07-14
	First 'public' version. This program replaces Qrms which could only 
	calculate RMS coordinate deviations (with no superimposision)
	Qcalc is a trajectory analysis program (but it can read restart files).
	It is designed to be used interactively, but input can of course be 
	redirected from a file.

	Qcalc works in three stages:
	1. Load topology.
	2. Set up a list of calculations to make.
	3. Read coordinates from trajectory and/or restart files and calculate.

	The following calculation kinds are available
	 1 RMS coord. deviation
	 2 Least squares fit
	 3 Distance, bond energy
	 4 Angle, angle energy
	 5 Torsion, torsion energy

	Multiple calculation of each kind can be done.
	For RMDs and fitting, an atom mask is used to select atoms.
